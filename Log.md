## Day 1 | july 11,2018
<strong> Tooday's progress:</strong> I have started with the basics of Machine Learning. Learned about basics of python through kaggle 7 days challenge upto 4, Linear regression and gradient descent concept by watching youtube videos.     
<strong> Thoughts:</strong> I'm very excited to complete this challenge. It was really fun.Happy Learning. 

## Day 2 | july 12,2018
<strong> Tooday's progress:</strong> I have implemnted Linear regression,learned about cost function and maths behind it.     
<strong> Thoughts:</strong> I faced many errors during implementation but I dubugged them.<br>

## Day 3 | July 13,2018
**Tooday's progress:** I learned about polynomial regression,feature normalization and [kaggle 7 days challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/colinmorris/learn-python-challenge-day-5) upto 5 days  
**Thoughts:** Well it was a busy day ,  but learn somthing about machine learning and watch youtube videos.
## Day 4 | July 14,2018
**Tooday's progress:** I watched some video tutorial on youtube and lynda, After that implemented Polynomial, multivariate regression and  feature Normalization  on dataset.<br>
**Thoughts:** A day full of errors. :octocat: <br>

## Day 1 | july 11,2018
<strong> Tooday's progress:</strong> I have started with the basics of Machine Learning. Learned about basics of python through kaggle 7 days challenge upto 4, Linear regression and gradient descent concept by watching youtube videos.     
<strong> Thoughts:</strong> I'm very excited to complete this challenge. It was really fun.Happy Learning. 

## Day 2 | july 12,2018
<strong> Tooday's progress:</strong> I have implemnted Linear regression,learned about cost function and maths behind it.     
<strong> Thoughts:</strong> I faced many errors during implementation but I dubugged them.<br>
<strong> Link of Work:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/imkhubaibraza/100DaysOfML/tree/master/Linear%20regression">Commit</a>
## Day 3 | July 13,2018
**Tooday's progress:** I learned about polynomial regression,feature normalization and [kaggle 7 days challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/colinmorris/learn-python-challenge-day-5) upto 5 days  
**Thoughts:** Well it was a busy day ,  but learn somthing about machine learning and watch youtube videos.
## Day 4 | July 14,2018
**Tooday's progress:** I watched some video tutorial on youtube and lynda, After that implemented Polynomial, multivariate regression and  feature Normalization  on dataset.<br>
**Thoughts:** A day full of errors. :octocat: <br>
**Link of Work:** [Commit](https://github.com/imkhubaibraza/100DaysOfML/tree/master/Polynomial%20Regression)
## Day 5 | July 15,2018
**Tooday's progress:** I read article [Linear Regression](https://medium.com/deep-math-machine-learning-ai/chapter-1-complete-linear-regression-with-math-25b2639dde23), [Multivariate Regression](https://towardsdatascience.com/building-a-multiple-linear-regression-model-and-assumptions-of-linear-regression-a-z-9769a6a0de42) and watched Youtube videos.Happy Sunday.<br>
**Thoughts:** Well, I spent my sunday to learn something new.  I'm trying to develop good understanding of these basic models and teachniques  <br>
**Link of someone effort:** [Python Notes](https://github.com/imkhubaibraza/python_notes) by [Kanav Bansal](https://github.com/bansalkanav)
## Day 6 | July 16,2018
**Tooday's progress:** Today, I tried to develop understanding of logistic regression. What can we do with Logistic regression. how is it differnet from linear regression, So I read some articles and watched youtube videos. Last but not the least, some time spent on statistics for good understanding of machine learning algorithms<br>
**Thoughts:** Well, I"m excited to learn something new everyday. No doubt best challenge accepted.<br>
## Day 7 | July 17,2018
**Tooday's progress:** Today, I focused on maths behind logistic regression. How can we understand things more clearly with maths and statistics. I will try to implement binary classification within one to two days. <br>
**Thoughts:** Well, It's not easy to understand statistics and mathematics(my own thoughts). But when you grasped the concept and main idea behind the formula. You will feel easy with Machine learning algorithms and model<br>
